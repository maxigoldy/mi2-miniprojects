# Hack the Web
Small little interactive fake-hacking-simulator / fake-hacking-site made in HTML/CSS/JS.
This is a university project for international media-informatics at HSB in Germany.

## Lessions learned:
It is kind of easy to create a small site that looks like a retro-hacker-site. I learned how to make a site responsive working. It was quite fun to think about some little missions to do and creating the whole project.
It took me around 60 minutes to finish this project.
To make it clear: This has nothing to do with hacking!
